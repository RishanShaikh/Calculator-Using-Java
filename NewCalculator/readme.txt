Hello dear friends.

This calculator is developed by me in java using Eclipse IDE. I was just practicing some basic functionalities of java e.g., AWT and swings,etc.

I know there is a big scope to make this calculator work more efficiently.

The functions were written by me and a lots of trial and errors are used to make them work properly and that's why the size of the code has increased very much.

You all are welcome to suggest me improve the coding.

Thank you.
